# Security Policy

The Cucumber team takes security very seriously and appreciates (and will endeavour to recognise publicly) people who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Cucumber-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests. Instead, please send an email to <team@cucumber.community>. Try to include as much detail as you can, including:

- The broad category of issue
- An unambiguous link to the vulnerable code - i.e. the file(s), but also git commit/tag/branch
- Configuration and other instructions required to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept code we can run (if possible)
- Summary of the issue's potential impact

## Response

Vulnerabilities will be disclosed initially to our enterprise partners Tidelift, and will subsequently be publicly disclosed once a patch is available.

Unless otherwise specified in the `SECURITY.md` in the individual repository, security patches will be released against the most recent version only. This applies to both vulnerabilities in the repository itself, and transitive dependency issues that are resolved by upgrading or removing.
